# Hypothyroid-Detection
Machine learning algorithms enable computers to learn from data and continuously enhance performance without explicit programming. Machine learning algorithms have significantly improved the accuracy and efficacy of thyroid diagnosis. This study identified and analysed the usefulness of several machine-learning algorithms in predicting hypothyroid profiles. The main goal of this study was to see the extent to which the algorithms adequately assessed whether a patient had hypothyroidism. Age, sex, health, pregnancy, and other factors are among the many factors considered. Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors are some of the machine learning methods used. For this work, two datasets were used and analysed. Data on hypothyroidism was gathered via DataHub and Kaggle. These algorithms were applied to the collected data based on metrics such as Precision, Accuracy, F1 score and Recall. The findings showed that the Extreme Gradient Boosting classification method outperformed the others regarding F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall. The research demonstrated how machine learning algorithms might predict thyroid profiles and identify thyroid-related illnesses.
